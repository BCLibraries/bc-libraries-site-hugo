"How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually to a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?" -Sophie Scholl, member of the White Rose

Opening in the Theology and Ministry Library Atrium Gallery on March 13, 2017, the White Rose is an inspiring exhibition depicting student resistance against Hitler in Munich during 1942-43. Created by The White Rose Foundation, this traveling exhibit is sponsored by the Boston College Libraries in collaboration with the Consulate General of Germany to New England. The exhibit will open with a panel discussion entitled: The White Rose: Invoking Moral Courage and Resistance from 4:00 – 5:00 PM followed by a reception from 5:00 – 6:30 PM. Consul General Ralf Horlemann will attend and will offer opening remarks.
