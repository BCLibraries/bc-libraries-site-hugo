In 21 pages of closely written entries in a slim 8" x 10" notebook, undertaker Thomas Murray (1774-1840) listed the names of those he buried. This partial record of interments at Bostonâ€™s earliest Catholic burying ground, St. Augustine Cemetery, was kept by Murray during a six-year period beginning in 1833. The newly-digitized document can now be viewed online.
