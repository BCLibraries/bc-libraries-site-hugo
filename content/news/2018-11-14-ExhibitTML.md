The Boston College Theology and Ministry Library (TML) is many things: a meeting place; a center of learning; a repository of treasured theological and philosophical wisdom; a venue wherein lessons are taught and artistic gifts are shared; a bridge between different expressions or understandings of church; an opportune setting for ministry and formation; and, for those of us privileged to be employed here, a cherished workplace. For ten years now, the TML has served its constituents – the School of Theology and Ministry (STM), St. John’s Seminary (SJS), the Theological Institute, and the broader BC community – nobly and well. This exhibit looks back at our decade of service, documents the growth and the change that has happened, and captures a bit of the human experience of the people of TML.
