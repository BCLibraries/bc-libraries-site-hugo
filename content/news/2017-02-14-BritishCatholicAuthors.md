There are many British Catholic authors featured in the John J. Burns Libraryâ€™s collections, and this exhibit focuses on three of them; Montague Summers, the eccentric vampire and werewolf chaser, Philip Caraman, SJ, the travelling Jesuit, and Hilaire Belloc, the poet, author, and humorist. Each author is highlighted with reproductions of letters, illustrations, and other items from our collections.
