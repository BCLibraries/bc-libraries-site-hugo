Most people live a life planned by others. That's why Thoreau's observation that "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" is even more true today than in the 19th century when he wrote those words. Our society is focused on teaching facts and figures (rote regurgitation) rather than nurturing true knowledge (insight and connecting the dots). Students graduate from college being able to write a more complete character description of George Washington than they can about themselves. There's an old adage that you can't truly love until you learn to love yourself. It's equally true that you can't understand others and the world around you unless you know and understand yourself. 20/20 Mind Sight provides a kickstart to a life of personal reflection and deep self-knowledge.
