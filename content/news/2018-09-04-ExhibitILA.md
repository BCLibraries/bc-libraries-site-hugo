The Institute for the Liberal Arts at Boston College was founded in 2008 to facilitate collaborative interdisciplinary research and teaching in the liberal arts. ILAMajor Grants have been a major vehicle for carrying out this mission andfund projects conceived by interdisciplinary teams of BC faculty who work together to advance knowledge and understanding across the liberal arts. Major grant projects receive funding between $2,500 and $25,000 and are awarded twice each year. As this exhibition of a selection of Major Grant projects reveals, BC faculty have carried out a wide range of innovative projects.
