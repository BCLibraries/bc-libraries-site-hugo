The foundation of Boston College is its Jesuit Catholic tradition. Buildings and open spaces are the places where reason and faith are nurtured; they are the locations – indoors and out – in which Boston College worships, teaches, studies, celebrates, plans, and reflects. As our community has evolved, so have its settings. This exhibit is an invitation to explore the locations where our students have become “men and women for others.”

Visit the touch tables in the O’Neill Library 3rd floor lobby and the Burns Library lobby to see the exhibit in action!
