Kaleidoscope, the International Relations and Global Studies Journal of Boston College, celebrates International Education Week 2017 by sharing a series of photos reflecting the theme of the year: "Being a Changemaker: The Heights & Beyond." All photos were submitted by Boston College students and Kaleidoscopeâ€™s editorial staff who traveled across the globe, from Bolivia to Mongolia. By representing regional and cultural diversity, our collection serves to promote a greater awareness and understanding of international issues.
