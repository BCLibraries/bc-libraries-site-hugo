Every year at Boston College includes waypointsâ€”annual events that anchor the academic and social seasons of the year.

From convocations to class reunions, the Boston College community gathers together to celebrate in religious services, athletic contests, fairs, festivals, dances, and other traditions.

Some traditions fade over time, while new ones begin. Some of these annual customs are highlighted here using material from the University Archives in John J. Burns Library.
