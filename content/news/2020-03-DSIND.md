A set of original handwritten letters housed in the Jesuit Archive in Rome has been scanned and transcribed and is now available freely on the web for research and study. A collaboration between Boston College Libraries, the Institute for Advanced Jesuit Studies and Emanuele Colombo of DePaul University, the Digital Indipetae Database offers an ordered glimpse into the mind and world of Jesuit priests applying for assignments worldwide for missionary work.
