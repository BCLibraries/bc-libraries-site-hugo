The Americans by Car is a retrospective of artist's archival work that pays tribute to two influential photographers, Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander. The photographs in the book were taken by Baden from his car and offer a snapshot of American life. A homage to Robert Frank's The Americans and Lee Friedlander's America by Car, Baden's book "is a personal, more specific answer to the vague question of 'how are we influenced,'" according to the artist.
