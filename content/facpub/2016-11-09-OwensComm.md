From the moment of their first client engagement, consultants in all fields face communication opportunities and challenges. No matter what their focus may be—professional services, accounting, technology, operations, human resources, manufacturing, or marketing—consultants drive change. That change, from its initial definition through its development and deployment, must be precisely communicated to a variety of audiences and through a variety of mediums. Most business communication books do a good job leading professional writers and presenters through the basics of audience, organization, formatting, and mechanics. But, only few focus on a specific business role, such as that of a consultant, and give guidance for communicating during all stages of a project. This book guides a current or would-be consultant through the various phases of a typical engagement and gives practical advice and direction on written and oral communication throughout a project.
