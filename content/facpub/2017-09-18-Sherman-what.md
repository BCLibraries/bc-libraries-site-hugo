This catalog surveys Mary Sherman’s work which straddles painting, sculpture, installation and performance. Painting, however, remains the driving force of Sherman's aesthetic approach, which conveys the form’s past mysteries, present incarnations and future possibilities. Conventional definitions of artistic disciplines are overturned in a journey that explores the relationships between paintings and sound with the aid of mechanics and digital tools.
