In <em>What Makes Education Catholic: Spiritual Foundations</em>, Thomas Groome discusses the history of Catholic education and the rich theological tradition that has shaped its development while focusing on how those foundations can give shape to its future.  He explores how educators can continue to draw on them for teaching in our postmodern context, and greatly enrich the experience of not only Catholic students but those of other faith backgrounds as well.
