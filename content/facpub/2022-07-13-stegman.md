The purpose of this book is to invite and assist readers to embark on a rewarding "journey" through texts in the New Testament that are "less trodden": the Letter to the Hebrews; James; 1 and 2 Peter; 1, 2, and 3 John; Jude; and Revelation. One reason these texts are less traveled is their placement in the New Testament canon. They are the final nine (of twenty-seven) writings in the New Testament. Another reason is that readings from these texts are rarely the subject of preaching in the Churchâ€™s Sunday Eucharistic liturgy.
