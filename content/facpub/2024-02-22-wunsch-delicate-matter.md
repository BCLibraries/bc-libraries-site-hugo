Eighteenth-century France witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of materially unstable art, from oil paintings that cracked within years of their creation to enormous pastel portraits vulnerable to the slightest touch or vibration. In <em>A Delicate Matter</em>, Oliver Wunsch traces these artistic practices to the economic and social conditions that enabled them: an ascendant class of art collectors who embraced fragile objects as a means of showcasing their disposable wealth.
Delicacy, which began the eighteenth century as a commodified extension of courtly sociability, was by century's end reimagined as the irreducible essence of art's autonomous value.
