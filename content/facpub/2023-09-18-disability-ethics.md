In <em>Disability Ethics and Preferential Justice: A Catholic Perspective</em>, Mary Jo Iozzio offers a theological reflection on disability, employing critical theory to identify the personal and structural forms of injustice people with disabilities experience under the control of able-bodied dominant society.  She draws on liberation theology within Catholic social teaching to discuss how individuals and the Christian church can work to address this reality and be more inclusive.  The book is a primer in an underdeveloped area of theological ethics.
