In <em>Sense of the Possible: An Introduction to Theology and Imagination</em>, Callid Keefe-Perry traces how theologians have understood the role that imagination plays in their field, drawing from a great variety of sources and perspectives to offer a treatment of the topic that is thorough, conceptual, and also practical.  He writes to make the subject matter accessible and provides guiding questions at the end of each chapter to facilitate deeper reflection and lists of related readings for those who would like to study further.
