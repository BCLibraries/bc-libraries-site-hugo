  <p>In the struggle for national independence, Irish   women had to fight both British imperialism and Irish sexism. They   organized politically and militarily. They fought alongside men, went to   jail, and on hunger strikes.</p>
  <p>Maud Gonne, Constance Markievicz, Margaret Skinnider, Kathleen   Clarke, and hundreds of other brave and determined women achieved their   purpose and place in history.</p>
  <p>Featuring newly acquired, never-before-seen documents and artifacts,   as well as an original 1916 Easter Rising Proclamation, this exhibition   tells their stories.</p>
