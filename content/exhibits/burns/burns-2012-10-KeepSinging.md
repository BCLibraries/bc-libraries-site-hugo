Dr. Theodore N. Marier (†2001) graduated from Boston College in 1934,   and stayed on to become director of the Musical Clubs and a lecturer on   music until WWII. Also in 1934, he began his work at St. Paul's Catholic   Church, Harvard Square, which lasted for 50 years. His musical interest   in the Catholic liturgy encompassed the organ, publishing, the schola   cantorum, and polyphony, but always remained centered on Gregorian   Chant, and the active participation of the congregation. This exhibit   was timed to mark the centenary of his birth, Oct. 17, 1912, and looks   in particular at his time at Boston College, using the newly digitized   and indexed collection of the <em>Boston College Heights</em>.
