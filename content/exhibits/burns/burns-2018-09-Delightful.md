Archives sometimes have the reputation of being dusty and (gasp!) boring, a place where archivists and researchers sort through mounds of paper. This exhibit argues that archival research is not monotonous work with only typed or handwritten documents. Instead, it reveals the known joy that researchers and archivists experience when finding doodles and drawings, illustrations and sketches amongst the collections. On display are items that amuse and delight our staff—hand-painted ceramics and prints, embroideries and stencils, scrapbooks and sketchbooks—selections demonstrating that there is so much more to archives than just words. 

Whether produced casually or professionally, for a functional purpose or to express creativity, art will always be a treat to discover in the archives. We hope you'll visit John J. Burns Library and find something delightful to draw your attention.
