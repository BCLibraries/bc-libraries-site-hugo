The John J. Burns Library recently processed its collection of Japanese prints with the assistance of Erin Furlong, a 2013-2014 Bookbuilders of Boston intern. The collection contains Japanese artwork dating from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. While the majority of the collection consists of ukiyo-e woodblock prints, there are also a number of examples of the mingei (folk art) movement and the sosaku hanga ("creative prints") movement of the early 20th century. This collection is now open to researchers.
