<em>Early Printed Books: History and Craft</em> is a Boston College   history course currently being taught by Professor Virginia Reinburg, in   conjunction with Burns Library Conservator Barbara Adams Hebard. In   this class, students have the opportunity to explore the vast changes   that the introduction of the printing press brought to Europe around the   seminar table with Professor Reinburg. In the conservator&rsquo;s lab, under   the guidance of Ms. Hebard, students work on projects that help them   understand the physicality of the books in the Burns. Starting with   simple techniques and tools, like folding paper to make St. Gall books,   the students will progress to more complicated techniques, like sewing   and blind tooling, making impressions on leather with hot brass tools.   Currently on display in the O&rsquo;Neill Library Reading Room are examples of   the crafts the students have produced so far this semester: volvelles,   known in the past as calculators, and St. Gall books, small books made   by folding paper with bone folders, a tool historically used by   bookbinders.  Everyone in the class was able to let their creativity   loose on each project, and no two finished pieces look alike. The   exhibition was curated by Boston College students Violet Caswell,   Danielle Nista, and Marianna Sorensen.
