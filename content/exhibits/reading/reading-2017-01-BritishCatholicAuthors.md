There are many British Catholic authors featured in the John J. Burns Libraryâ€™s collections, and this exhibit focuses on three of them; <strong>Montague Summers</strong>, the eccentric vampire and werewolf chaser, <strong>Philip Caraman, SJ</strong>, the travelling Jesuit, and <strong>Hilaire Belloc</strong>, the poet, author, and humorist.  Each author is highlighted with reproductions of letters, illustrations, and other items from our collections.
