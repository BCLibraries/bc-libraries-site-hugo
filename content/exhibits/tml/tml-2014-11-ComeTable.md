<p>Come to the Table, a national traveling art exhibit, features   thirty-five carefully selected works, including historical pieces by   Albrecht Dürer, modernist work by Jasper Johns and Sadao Watanabe, and   fresh contemporary pieces created by member artists of Christians in the   Visual Arts (CIVA). This work, executed in a variety of media,   celebrates the rich biblical metaphor of the Table—a place of   invitation, relationship, abundance, generosity, and   reconciliation—where communities gather and where worshippers encounter   the grace of God.</p>
