Drawing together the words of Pope Francis&rsquo;s encyclical letter <em>Laudato Si&rsquo;</em> with a selection of corresponding images, this exhibit is an invitation   to actively reflect on the concerns, challenges, hopes—and call to   action—for the care <em>of our common home </em>so powerfully expressed in the encyclical.
