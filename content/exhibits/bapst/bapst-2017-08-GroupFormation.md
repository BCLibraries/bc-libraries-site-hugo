Since the 1860s, Boston College students have enriched their academic performance, developed leadership skills, and affected their community by joining together in co-curricular activities. The Boston College yearbook, <em>Sub Turri</em>, has featured photographs of students since it began publication in 1913. This exhibit includes some historical images of student organizations along with more modern material from a recent Student Involvement Fair. We invite you to learn more about the students of Boston College through further exploration of this exhibit, <em>Sub Turri</em>, and other archival resources.
