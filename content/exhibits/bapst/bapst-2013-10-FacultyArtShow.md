ArtClub&rsquo;s <em>Fall Faculty/Staff Show</em> gives BC employees the   opportunity to display their artwork to the Boston College community. It   serves as a platform for faculty and staff from both art-related and   non-art departments to show side by side, which often results in   engaging conversations between work due to the large breadth of subject   matter and ideas dealt with. Concurrently, the show calls to mind the   universalities of the art-making process. The effect of the show on the   BC student body is invaluable, as the work provides not only potential   inspiration for student work but also reveals the hidden talents and   interests of BC faculty. For art department faculty, the show provides   students with a chance to personally engage with works they may have   only heard about or seen in photographs and reproductions.
