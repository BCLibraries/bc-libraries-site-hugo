The Faculty & Staff Art Show is an outlet for all faculty and staff to showcase the wonderful work they create throughout the year. The reception provides a time for faculty, staff, and students to come together and celebrate art! It is also a great way to spend time talking about art and using it as a vessel for communication between so many disciplines and positions across the campus.
