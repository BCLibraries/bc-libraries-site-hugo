<em>Stylus Magazine</em> of Boston College, the literature and art magazine on campus, celebrates 130 years of student submissions with <em>Art Beat Stylus.</em> The exhibit includes some of the excellent student work featured   throughout the magazine's storied history, along with pieces from the   most recent Fall 2012 issue. <em>Stylus</em> publishes once a semester entirely from student submissions and has an entirely student staff.
