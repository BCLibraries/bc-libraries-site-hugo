Yusnaby Perez, a Cuban blogger born in 1988 in the small Havana   neighborhood of Miramar, captures the day to day lives of the Cuban   people through photographs, letters, and op-eds in his self-titled blog <a href="http://www.yusnaby.com/">www.yusnaby.com</a>.    Yusnaby strives to share the realities of Cuba that stem from his   experience living on the island nation, which has been politically and   economically isolated since the Communist Revolution of 1959.
