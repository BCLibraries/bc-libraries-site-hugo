During the 2016 Hispanic Heritage Month Photo Exhibit, students and   administrators wanted to focus on showcasing the beauty of Latin   American culture. More importantly, we wanted to focus on the beauty   beyond the clich√© tourist sites and place an emphasis on the beauty of   everyday life. As members of the vibrant Latin community, we honor where   we came from and maintain the traditions of our ancestors. As we grow   and move away from our countries of origin, we carry our heritage   through generations and borders. We reflect our heritage through   everyday activities in our workplace, institutions of higher learning,   and at home. We continue to grow as individuals with a new identity but   we never forget where we came from and how we got here.
