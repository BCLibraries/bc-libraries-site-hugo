<p><em><strong>The Power of Youth Movements in Black History</strong></em> is an   exhibit that showcases the spirit and fight of young Black men and   women, and their allies, exhibited by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and   the youth of today. These images are meant to spark educated dialect   around the reality of the current state of our nation. I want my pieces   to evoke emotion and feelings from the viewer. I encourage everyone who   is viewing my work to have an opinion and to openly express those   opinions in a manner that is respectful and thoughtful...One reason I   chose to attend BC is its emphasis on social justice, which is rooted in   &ldquo;the University's broader mission and Jesuit tradition.&rdquo; I feel like I   would be doing a disservice to the university and Jesuits if I chose not   to practice what is being preached, don&rsquo;t you agree?Â </p>
