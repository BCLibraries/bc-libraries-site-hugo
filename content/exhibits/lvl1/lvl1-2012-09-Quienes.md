The 4th annual Hispanic Heritage Month Committee, sponsored by the   Office of AHANA Student Programs, The Oscar Romero Committee, the Boston   College Libraries, and Latinos at BC presents the first <em>¿Quienes Somos?</em> photo exhibition.  This effort is a proud extension of this year&rsquo;s HHM   theme &ldquo;¿Quiénes Somos?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who Are We?&rdquo;  The photographs collected for   display were taken by students from their immersion trips to Latin   American countries.  The images capture the life, scenery, and culture   of who Latinos are.  At Boston College this year HHM will kick off with   an opening festival in O&rsquo;Neill Plaza on Friday, September 14th.  There will be 3 main events throughout the month followed by our grand closing.  Be sure to check them out!
