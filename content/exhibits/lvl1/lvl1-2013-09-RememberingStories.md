<em>Remembering Their Stories</em>, Sponsored by the recent Mustard Seed   Dominican Republic service trip through Boston College Campus Ministry   and The Boston College Libraries, <em>Remembering Their Stories</em> seeks   to draw attention to the most memorable parts of service work abroad:   the people one meets and the relationships that one forms. Whether it a   community member, a local person served, a supervisor, or even other   volunteers, people are integral factors to understanding a country and   culture. This exhibit would like to acknowledge all of those people who   have had profound effects on Boston College students throughout their   time doing service work abroad.
