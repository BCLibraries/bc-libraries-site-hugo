Every Bostonian has a fond relation to the Charles River, a symbol of   our city. After decades of having notoriously polluted waters, the   Charles has gained an infamous reputation as a toxic river system. In   recent years, however, one of the most successful environmental   restorations of New England has transformed the nasty waters into the   safe and swimmable Charles it is today. Through images of the history of   the pollution of the Charles River and the clean-up efforts of the   twenty-first century, EcoPledge presents an environmental success that   is close to home, leaving only the question of if we ever did LOVE that   dirty water.
