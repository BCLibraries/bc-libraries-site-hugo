What do you think of when you think of creating art? 
Art Club wants to expand what it means to create art, especially in our digital era.
This is Art Club's first Digital Art Show, ranging in works from digital photography to photo manipulations. We want to show that art doesn't have to be confined to just painting or drawing, but digital work as well.
