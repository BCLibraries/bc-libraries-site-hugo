eARThproject incorporates still images from NASA global climate models with photographs of environmental degradation and destruction to increase public awareness and education about the intricate climatic processes which control our current global climate. By displaying scientific modeling images as works of art, we hope to draw students and faculty into a greater understanding of the simultaneous power and vulnerability of the Earth's climate and the ways in which anthropogenic activity is changing the systems upon which we depend for life. These processes occur on such a macro scale it is difficult to visualize how clouds move or how a hurricane forms or how our emissions can affect the patterns of deep ocean circulation, but by presenting the processes as something beautiful to be protected, we can foster a sense of care for our common home. <em>â€“ Brigid Rooney, MCAS, '19</em>
