In the studio art course Art and Digital Technology, taught by Boston College Fine Arts Department Faculty members Karl Baden and Toni Dan, students produce a variety of design and art-oriented pieces, including magazine spreads, posters, advertisements, and CD covers, using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator as creative tools. This exhibition consists of excerpts from the final projects of students.
