<p><em>Espresso Your Faith</em>, This exhibition is a snapshot of how   faith is celebrated on the Boston College campus during one week in   October. This week-long celebration, which includes events like Agape   Latte, Taize Prayer and Frisbee with the Jesuits, aims to bring the   Boston College community together while offering countless opportunities   to witness and reflect on how faith reveals itself in our day to day   lives. From academics to art, from athletics to liturgy, from coffee and   conversations to the Word, Espresso Your Faith Week transforms,   empowers and enlightens.</p>
<p>&quot;Espresso Your Faith Week&quot; is sponsored by Campus Ministry and the   Church in the 21st Century Center (C21) at Boston College, which serves   as a catalyst and resource for the renewal of the Catholic Church. For   more information about C21 please visit <a href="http://www.bc.edu/c21">www.bc.edu/c21</a>.
