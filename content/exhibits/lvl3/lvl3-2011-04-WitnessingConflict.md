This project by Fine Arts Professor Charles A. Meyer is a photographic survey of regions where people of differing ethnic backgrounds of religious persuasions are in conflict. The series examines perspectives of peace, reconciliation, and restorative justice among the perpetrators, victims and/or survivors of these conflictsâ€”all of whom have come to understand the necessity for reconciliation.
