<em>New Deal Utopias</em> examines three planned communities conceived and constructed by the federal government during the Great Depression. Greenbelt, Maryland; Greenhills, Ohio, and Greendale, Wisconsin – collectively known as "Greenbelt Towns" – were built to embody the hope that American citizens would meet the challenges of the Depression in a spirit of cooperation, not individualism.
