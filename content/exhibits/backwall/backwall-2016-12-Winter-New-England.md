Ah, "winter in New England", thereâ€™s a phrase to conjure up visions.  Snow, snow, snow.  It blankets and transforms, revealing a sparkling new, washed-clean world.  Here we see not only the art of winter described in literature and painting, but also the science, as we approach this new season.  The Boston College campus presents a beautiful back-drop for some of these wintry scenes.  The winter of two years ago humbled us, and last winter emboldened us, what will Father Winter bring to New England this year?
