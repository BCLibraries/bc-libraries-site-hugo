Yom HaShoah is the day that honors the memory of the victims of the   Holocaust (1933-1945).  This year Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance   Day, is recognized from sundown May 4 to sundown May 5. In the Nazi-era,   six million Jews and millions of others -- including homosexuals,   gypsies, political and religious dissenters, and the disabled -- were   murdered in concentration camps, extermination camps, and mass public   executions.  The enormity of this collective human loss remains   unfathomable. This exhibit recognizes three Jewish women artists who   died in the Auschwitz concentration camp: writer Irène Némirovsky,   violinist Alma Rosé, and painter Charlotte Salomon.  Kiev born and   French dwelling Irène Némirovsky, best known for the posthumous   bestselling novella <em>Suite française</em>, was the author of more than a   dozen novels in her lifetime.  Alma Rosé, niece of composer Gustav   Mahler, was the founder of a women&rsquo;s orchestra, <em>The Waltzing Girls of Vienna</em>.    And Berliner Charlotte Salomon created an autobiographical series of   769 paintings while hiding in the south of France known as <em>Life? or Theater?</em> We invite you to explore these women&rsquo;s lives in Boston College Libraries.
