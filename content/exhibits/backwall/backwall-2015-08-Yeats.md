The friends that have it I do wrong<br>

  Should know what issue is at stake:<br>
  It is I myself that I remake.<br>

  William Butler Yeats, untitled
</div>

<p>Nobel prize-winning Irish writer William Butler Yeats often revised   and in some cases rewrote his lyrics. The brief poem above indicates not   only a care for sound and quality of lyric, but the evolution of the   interior life of his mind and soul. Yeats&rsquo;s exploration of religious and   spiritual matters drove such progressive transformations.</p>
<p>In a long and richly lived life (1865-1939), Yeats wove artistic   techniques around and through belief systems that evolved as did his   artistic work, his firmly-held beliefs about nation, his love interests,   and family relationships.</p>
<p>By using material from the Thomas P. O&rsquo;Neill, Jr. Library, this   exhibit aims to trace such artistic, personal, and spiritual evolution.</p>
