Many of us here at Boston College are lucky enough to do it three times a day, or more.  It's fundamental to life.  It's also fundamental to making us who we are.  The dinner table is at the heart of the family -- where the family comes together for nourishment, but also to share news of the day, as well as stories about each other and the wider world.  It provides a chance to nestle inward, in the embrace of the family, but it's also a place to connect to the past, the culture and earlier generations, especially if the family has left behind its heritage in moving to the United States.  

Take a journey here into the amazing gift of community that the table offers each of us, as reflected in the Boston College Libraries collections.
