<strong>Welcome to BC! </strong>

Along with Baldwin, the feathery guy in the first case, we want to help introduce you to Boston College, to living in Boston … and give you some tips on getting used to college life.  In addition to tips on BC services to help you settle in academically and socially, you’ll also glimpse some BC history depicted over the years in The Heights.   Start to learn about sports, BC-style, but you’ll also find some tips on getting to know your new home, Boston.  There’s so much to explore and navigate, ranging from dorm-life, college classes and expectations, but also the “T” and the wider world beyond the college gates on Comm Ave.  Check out (really, check out!) the books on the nearby cart to do more exploring.

<strong>Welcome to College!</strong>

Starting college, wherever it is, is a big adjustment, so we’ve put together a set of resources that you might find helpful – whether it’s for dorm life, getting control of your finances, or learning to balance your academic work with your social life.   There are all sorts of terrific services and people here at Boston College who want to help as you get settled.  And, don’t forget the Answer Wall – it’s all seeing, all knowing – and it’s nearby, in the O’Neill Lobby.  See Answer Wall snippets in these cases – as you’ll see, you’re not the only one with that question.  Sometimes the answer is just to go apple-picking with friends, get enough sleep … and invest in a planner app.

<strong>Welcome to Boston!</strong>

And, life at BC is so much more than just campus and classes – here are tips on exploring Boston and its distinctive neighborhoods.  First thing, get a Charlie Card, then the city is your oyster (well, in New England, you might say, clam).  Learn about BC museum passes that will help you clear your brain after a week of studying – the MFA, the Science Museum, and lots more.  You might want to attend a pennant-stretch game at Fenway (we can hope, always), visit the swan-boats and ducklings in the Public Garden, head out to the Harbor Islands for the day, head north to the White Mountains for some quality hiking or to southern Maine for some quality lobster.  Carpe diem, and get the most out of every moment that you’re here at BC!
