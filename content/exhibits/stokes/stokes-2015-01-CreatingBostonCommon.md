<p>Created and curated by History Department majors,   the Spring 2015 Making History Public exhibition illuminates the history   of Boston Common over the past four centuries. &ldquo;Creating Boston Common:   The Evolution of America&rsquo;s Oldest Park&rdquo; examines the history of this   50-acre site from its occupancy by Massachusett native peoples, to its   use as common grazing lands, to its development as a public park.   Chronicling the changing uses of urban public space, the exhibition   explores the myriad activities of Bostonians who have used the Common to   earn a living, wage war, enjoy nature and recreation, and promote a   variety of political and religious causes.</p>
