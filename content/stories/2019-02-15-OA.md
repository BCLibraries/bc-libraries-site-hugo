The Libraries, in collaboration with the Provost, have established a fund to finance payment of article and monograph processing fees for Boston College authors who wish to publish in open access journals. Open access funds demonstrate an institutionâ€™s concrete support for new and innovative research publishing models. The fund is administered through the University Libraries.
