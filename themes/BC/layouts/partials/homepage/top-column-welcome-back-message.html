    <p>Welcome Back! We are ready to provide a full suite of services (<em>with some modifications, of course</em>). 
        <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/ask-a-librarian/subject-librarians">Research consultations</a>, <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/library-instruction">instruction classes</a>, and <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/ask-a-librarian">reference services</a> will be online.  
        Nearly all <a href="https://library.bc.edu/courses">Course Reserves</a> will be online.  
        To meet CDC and Massachusetts guidelines, there is reduced seating, <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/hours">hours</a>, and public technology. 
        Because masks should remain on, all libraries will have a "no food" policy, although most will still allow drinks. 
        <em>Check it out</em> &mdash; the 5th floor study area in O'Neill was enlarged to provide more seating overlooking downtown Boston!</p>
    <p>For the latest information, consult the BC Libraries' homepage and the <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/servicesupdate">BC Libraries Updates page</a>.</p>
