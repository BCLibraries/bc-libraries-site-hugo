    <p>Welcome Back! We are providing a full suite of services (with some modifications, of course). 
        <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/ask-a-librarian/subject-librarians">Research consultations</a>, <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/library-instruction">instruction classes</a>, and <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/ask-a-librarian">reference services</a> are online.  
        Nearly all <a href="https://library.bc.edu/courses">Course Reserves</a> are online.  
        To meet CDC and Massachusetts guidelines, there are <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/policies/covid-19#s-lg-box-wrapper-28998444">building access requirements</a>, reduced seating, <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/hours">hours</a>, and public technology. 
        Because masks should remain on, all libraries will have a "no food" policy, although most will still allow drinks. 
        Check it out &mdash; the 5th floor study area in O'Neill was enlarged to provide more seating overlooking downtown Boston!</p>
    <p>For the latest information, consult the BC Libraries' homepage and the <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/servicesupdate">BC Libraries Updates page</a>.</p>
