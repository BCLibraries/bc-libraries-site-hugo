        <p>Exhibits in Oâ€™Neill are part of the Library's educational outreach and are specifically created 
            to stimulate interest in, and encourage further study of, the topics showcased in the displays. 
            One case is devoted to campus events, and the remaining are open to exhibits which highlight collections, 
            spotlight interesting research being done on campus, explore current and/or historically important events, 
            or demonstrate cultural trends and their significance for the BC community.</p>
