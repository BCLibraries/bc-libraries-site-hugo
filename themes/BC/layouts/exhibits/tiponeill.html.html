                    <p>The exhibit features displays from many facets of O'Neill's life: his North Cambridge neighborhood, his BC years, his legacy as speaker, and his political campaigns. His voice can be heard over audio speakers, a television provides video clips of some of his speeches, and a computer station enables visitors to learn more about his life and legacy.</p>
