                    <h3>Archived Exhibits from the Bapst Student Gallery</h3>
                    <p>In the spring of 2004, Bapst Art Library became the host for the first ever Boston College student art gallery. The gallery is a joint endeavor of the Bapst Art Library, the Fine Arts Department, and ArtVision, a student group for the promotion of the arts on campus. The gallery features a range of media including painting, sketches, watercolors, photography, and ceramic sculptures. Students plan, jury, hang, and manage several exhibits throughout the year. <br />
                    <em>Note: This gallery is no longer in use.</em></p>
