            <p>Exhibits in the Boston College University Libraries will advance discovery of library resources 
                by highlighting connections between our collections and academic and community life at BC. 
                The Libraries welcome partnerships with the Boston College community and other institutions, 
                groups, or individuals to create thoughtful and attractive exhibits. Successful exhibit proposals 
                will be in strong alignment with the mission and collections of the Libraries.</p>
